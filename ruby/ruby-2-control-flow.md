# Ruby - Control Flow

Control flow is very important in programming for executing one path or another based on a condition that is being tested. This is often combined with a boolean test for true or false. If someone has successfully entered 
their credentials, then set up their session and grant them access. Else, if the conditional test returns false, then redirect them to the sign-up page.

Another interesting item is the implementation of `Elsif` rathen than `Else If` or even `Elif` as seen in other programming languages.

#### Prompt for User Input

```
print "Integer please: "
user_num = Integer(gets.chomp)

if user_num < 0
  puts "You picked a negative integer!"
elsif user_num > 0
  puts "You picked a positive integer!"
else
  puts "You picked zero!"
end
```

#### If-Elsif

```
x = 10
y = 5
if x < y
    print "x is less than y"
elsif x > y
    print "x is greater than y"
else
    print "x equals y"
end
```

#### Unless

```
hungry = true

unless hungry
  puts "I'm writing Ruby programs!"
else
  puts "Time to eat!"
end
```

#### Boolean Expressions

```
test_1 = 77 != 77
print test_1

test_2 = -4 <= -4
print test_2

test_3 = -44 < -33
print test_3

test_4 = 100 == 1000
print test_4
```

#### Boolean Expressions with `&&`

```
boolean_1 = 77 < 78 && 77 < 77
print boolean_1

boolean_2 = true && 100 >= 100
print boolean_2

boolean_3 = 2**3 == 8 && 3**2 == 9
print boolean_3
```

#### Boolean Expressions with `||`

```
boolean_1 = 2**3 != 3**2 || true
print boolean_1

boolean_2 = false || -10 > -9
print boolean_2

boolean_3 = false || false
print boolean_3
```

#### Boolean Expressions with `!`

```
boolean_1 = !true
print boolean_1

boolean_2 = !true && !true
print boolean_2

boolean_3 = !(700 / 10 == 70)
print boolean_3
```

#### Compound Boolean Expressions

```
boolean_1 = (3 < 4 || false) && (false || true)
print boolean_1

boolean_2 = !true && (!true || 100 != 5**2)
print boolean_2

boolean_3 = true || !(true || false)
print boolean_3
```
