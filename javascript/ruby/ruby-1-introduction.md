# Ruby Basics

The follow are some basic examples of Ruby - most of these examples should run just fine, but these are intended as more notes and starters. Some of these probably require fixes and all can be expanded upon when practicing Ruby development.

Comments and explanations are a bit sparse, and really non-existent, but since this is a living document, that can change over time. The goal here was to find a place to store some examples of Ruby syntax and structure.

#### Variables

```
my_num = 25         # Add your code here!
my_boolean = true   # And here!
my_string = "Ruby"  # Also here.
```

#### Print Output

```
puts "Hello World"
print "Hello again, World"
```

#### String Functions

```
puts "Ruby is fun!".upcase
puts "Ruby is fun!".downcase
puts "Ruby is fun!".reverse
puts "Ruby is fun!".length
```

#### Assignment
 
```
my_name = "John Stark"
my_age = 40
```

#### Math Operations

```
sum = 13 + 379
product = 923 * 15
quotient = 13209 / 17
```

#### Method Chaining

```
name = "Black Widow"
puts name.downcase.reverse.upcase
```
